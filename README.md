WHAT IS A SERVICE IN ANGULAR?????

ANGULAR SERVICE is just a simple class which is used to centralize data and can be excessed throughtout the whole app...


Angular Services using it the wrong way.   we should not use it directly by intenciating the Service class instead should use dependency injection
